# 📘 Project: Churn Prediction

This project focuses on understanding **why customers leave** and **identifying who is most at risk**, using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning readiness techniques.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
Use customer metrics to quantify:
- **How likely** each customer is to churn  
- **Who** is most likely to churn  
- **Why** certain customer groups show higher churn tendencies  

The goal is to provide businesses with **early insight** so they can take action and retain existing customers.

---

## 🧹 Phase 1 — Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Standardized data types and removed inconsistencies  
- Handled missing values  
- Prepared numerical and categorical features for analysis and modeling  

---

## 🔎 Phase 2 — Univariate Analysis
A feature-by-feature review to understand:
- The distribution of each variable  
- Key customer segments  
- Patterns that may influence churn behavior  

This phase highlighted important variables such as **tenure**, **contract type**, **payment method**, and **service subscriptions**.

---

## 🧪 Next Step — Bivariate Hypotheses to Test
These hypotheses guide the deeper analysis:

1. **Contract Type → Churn**  
   Customers on *Month-to-month* contracts churn the most.

2. **Tenure → Churn**  
   Newer customers (low tenure) have the highest churn rate.

3. **Services → Churn**  
   Customers with fewer subscribed services churn more often.

4. **Payment Method → Churn**  
   Electronic check users have a higher churn probability.

## 📈 Goal of the Full Project
Build a churn prediction pipeline that allows businesses to:
- Identify at-risk customers  
- Understand the root causes  
- Prioritize retention strategies  
- Reduce churn and boost long-term customer value
